# JS Playground

This project is an open-source JS playground where you can execute JavaScript code and see the preview on the other side. You can use `show()` to display any expression on the preview window.

[Demo here](https://mistrykaran91.github.io/js-playground/)

## Want to import a 3rd-party library?

You can import libraries like you do in a normal JS file.

```
  Eg:- import _ from lodash
```

There are already two libraries included.

- React
- ReactDOM

## Want to run locally?

```
  npm install
  npm start // visit localhost:8080
```
